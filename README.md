# VERN Core

The VERN core is a new methodology for building website. The central idea behind VERN is distribution. Processing is performed client-side whenever possible, thus reducing the load on servers enabling them to scale further. The only issue this presents is for SEO in web applications. If your project needs SEO, utilize the SEO manager built into VERN's admin panel.

## Install

`npm install -g vern`

You will use VERN inside your server to create routes, controllers, and models.

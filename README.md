# Vern Core

Vern Core is the backend for all Vern-based applications. It is a very easy to use and powerful API builder.

## Documentation

The best method for utilizing Vern is by using the [vern-cli](http://www.vern.io) module to create a full-stack boilerplate for your project.

However, if you're interested in using Vern as a low level API builder, please continue reading.
